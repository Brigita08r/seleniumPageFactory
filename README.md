# Page Object Model (POM) & Page Factory | Selenium

Page Object is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members. Page Factory is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.

POM is mostly used for enhancing test maintenance and reducing code duplication.

In Selenium the PageFactory Class is an extension to the Page Object design pattern. It is used to initialize the Page Object elements or instantiate the Page Objects itself.
